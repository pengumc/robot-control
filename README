Version 0.4
XY control for 2 connected 3DOF legs with gtk gui
  .___.X.___.
./           \.
|             |

keyboard:
 'q' : disconnect timeout routine, resulting in no more controller polling.
 wasd : change both leg endPoints (up left down right)
 WASD : change single leg endPoint (leg dictated by second button, click to switch)
 '`' : reset and reconnect usb.
 any key will refresh the actual servo positions stored in the device.
controller:
 right analog: same as wasd
 triangle: set analog mode for controller (red led on the controller)
 with R1 pressed:
  right analog: control leg 0
  left analog control leg 1


GUI
some visualization has bee added.

NOTES:
----------------------------------
WINDOWS (minGW)
gtk is being a bitch on windows so support is dropped for now.

g++ (4 or higher)
libgmp
libmpc
libmpfr
gcc-core
gsl libraries: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gsl.htm
change switch $(LINUX) with $(WINDOWS) in the makefile
note: some timings are wrong on windows atm, making input slow

32BITS:
the gsl libraries are 64 bit, so you'll have to build those yourself.
