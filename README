|             |

keyboard:
 'q' : disconnect timeout routine, resulting in no more controller polling.

 any key will refresh the actual servo positions stored in the device.
controller:
 right analog: same as wasd
 triangle: set analog mode for controller (red led on the controller)

some visualization has bee added.

libgmp
libmpc
libmpfr
gcc-core
gsl libraries: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gsl.htm
change switch $(LINUX) with $(WINDOWS) in the makefile
note: some timings are wrong on windows atm, making input slow
